# hello-world
This is my first repository!

My name is Nick, I 'm a Mathematician and I am currently attending seminars at Hellenic Actuarial Society.\
I love data and how we can mine information from them.\
Whenever I have free time I like to work on some personal projects related to data analysis.

You can follow me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/nschizas12) though!
